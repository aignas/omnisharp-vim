# Python client for OmniSharp-Roslyn

This is an attempt to get the OmniSharp-Roslyn a first class citizen within Vim and Neovim.

## Why would you create a new implementation for roslyn?

Why not?  IMHO, the old python code is very hard to extend and it serves well only then standard server.
I wanted to make a few additions in order to make it more useful for using it with `neovim` and `neomake`,
but at the same time and did not want to break any backwards compatibility.
As such, I decided to try and write a new implementation.

## TDD

I am a fan of TDD and I hope to get everything done via a good TDD approach.

## Implemented features

Nothing so far
